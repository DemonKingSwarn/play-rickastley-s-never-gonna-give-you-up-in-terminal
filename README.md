yeah you heard it right, you can play rick astley's never gonna give you up in terminal.

<a href="https://github.com/Minelordsuniverse">Minelordsuniverse</a> a friend of mine actually helped me with this.

## To run this script:

open your terminal after downloading the script and type `chmod +x rickroll.py` and press enter and then just run it by double clicking or type `./rickroll.py` in terminal and press enter.

Have a good time rick rolling your friends :)
